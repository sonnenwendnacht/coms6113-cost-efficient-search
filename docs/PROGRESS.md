# Resumable checkpoint

Updated: 2026-09-28 03:27 ET.

## Research branch

- Algorithm branch: `research/algorithm2-sequential-comparison`.
- Main experiment branch: `research/experiment1-nine-models`.
- The algorithm branch contains CW-PLR, CACR, and the gated SCCR prototype,
  synthetic iid/smooth/permuted controls, the pilot trace-locality diagnostic,
  and the expanded related-work boundary. The latest pushed algorithm commit
  is checked by the repository's offline CI.
- Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -q` for the current offline test
  suite (30 tests).

## Long local trace

- Run ID: `exp1-nine-local-20260927-proper`.
- Status observed at this checkpoint: `60,300 / 291,600` cells (`20.68%`),
  still running in PID `8763`.
- Status file: `results/runs/exp1-nine-local-20260927-proper/status.json`.
- The runner writes resumable JSONL checkpoints. If the machine is restarted,
  resume with the same command and add `--resume --run-id
  exp1-nine-local-20260927-proper`; do not start a second run with the same
  output directory.
- This run is not complete and has not produced a nine-model result. The
  small 27-row pilot remains descriptive only.

## Next research gate

When the nine-model trace completes, run every selector only on the search
questions, enforce equal realized profiling dollars, and evaluate the chosen
complete row on the untouched audit questions. Report search spend, held-out
accuracy, cold deployment cost, and uncertainty separately. Compare CACR/SCCR
with AgentOpt selectors, synchronized paired elimination, random/uniform
allocation, direct cost-aware allocation, and the hybrid-feedback baseline.

The replay command now accepts `--include-structured` to add CW-PLR, CACR,
and SCCR at explicit realized-cost fractions. It has been smoke-tested on the
completed 27-row pilot via a local fixture; the 729-row run remains pending.
